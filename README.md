## Install Dependencies

Install nodejs and npm. On Mac OS X, the easiest way to accomplish this is with `brew`:

```
$ brew install node
```

Next, install Gulp and Bower to get their CLI tools:

```
$ npm install -g gulp bower`
```

## Development Server

```
$ gulp serve
```

This will start a local server to access the application. It will also watch for changes and automatically reload the page when necessary.

## Building

```
$ gulp build
```

## Testing

```
$ gulp test
```
